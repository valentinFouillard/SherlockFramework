# SherlockFramework

Sherlock is framework that allows to model erroneous decision making of a human agent and to compute the possible beliefs states that could explain his decisions. Moreover this framework offers a range of cognitive explanations based on the  cognitive bias litterature to provide insight into the plausibility belief state.

# Setup

Sherlock uses the Z3 SMT solver to compute each possible belief state of the agent. Therefore before even trying to run Sherlock you must install Z3 which you can find at https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.
